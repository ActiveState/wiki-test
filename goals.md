# Goals
1. In Q4 build the system that let someone Contributors a new language core and build tools
2. In Q1 this will be marketed heavily
3. Success is outsiders (including contractors we hire) can add to our offerings
4. It's light weight that people can hear about it and start playing with it now
5. It unifies our current thinking
6. We can implement something over our current APIs not strat over
