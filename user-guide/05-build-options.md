## Build Options
Most software components on the internet that can be compiled have different options that can be set at compile that impact the behavior of the outputted component. For example many C-libraries let you enable Debugging which produces a binary that correlates execution statements to original lines of code in the binary (at the expensive of bigger slower binaries). 

```
./co -o DEBUG
```
